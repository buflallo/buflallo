### Software Engineering Student at @1337-Benguerir (42 Network).

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Hamza, a passionate and seasoned software engineer with a deep-rooted love for crafting innovative solutions across diverse tech stacks.

ðŸ’» With a solid foundation in low-level programming and architectural design, I've embarked on numerous challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. From meticulously architecting a fully-functional Linux shell, adept at parsing complex commands and executing them seamlessly, to crafting a captivating 3D game from scratch using C with ray tracing and rendering intricacies, I thrive on tackling the most intricate technical puzzles.

ðŸš€ My journey extends beyond the depths of low-level programming, venturing into the realm of high-level frameworks such as Node.js, Nest.js, React.js, and PHP Laravel. Leveraging this diverse skill set, I've spearheaded transformative projects, including a real-time multiplayer game powered by TypeScript in Nest.js and React, delivering an immersive gaming experience that transcends device boundaries.

ðŸ”§ Beyond individual projects, I've played a pivotal role in collaborative endeavors, fostering teamwork and knowledge sharing among peers. Whether it's architecting scalable server infrastructures, building seamless chat interfaces with real-time updates, or optimizing server performance to handle thousands of concurrent requests, I'm committed to driving collective success through collaboration and innovation.

ðŸŽ“ As a graduate of FSTF, I bring not only technical prowess but also a thirst for continuous learning and growth. My dedication to mastering emerging technologies and refining my craft fuels my unwavering commitment to delivering excellence in every project I undertake.

ðŸŒŸ If you're as passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology as I am, let's connect and embark on an exciting journey of innovation and collaboration!
